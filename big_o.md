## **Space Complexity**

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It consists of two main components:

- **Auxiliary Space**: This refers to the extra space used by the algorithm itself, apart from the input. It includes the memory required by the variables, data structures, and other internal components of the algorithm.

- **Space Used for Input Values**: This is the memory required to store the input data that the algorithm operates on.

So, the overall space complexity of is the sum of the auxiliary space and the space used for input values:

`Space Complexity = O(1) (Auxiliary Space) + O(N) (Space Used for Input Values) = O(N)`
